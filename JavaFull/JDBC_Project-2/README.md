# First JDBC Project

This repository houses a comprehensive implementation of java coding connecting to MySQL dataBase and dealing with services, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, design patterns, code structuring, and other relevant concepts.

## Project Overview

### Code Implementation
The repository includes a fully functional JDBC project that demonstrates the application of OOP principles and design patterns. Key features and aspects covered in the project:

- Complete implementation using Java
- Utilization of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Integration of design patterns for code organization and maintainability
- Integration of JDBC concepts like CRUD and connections with dataBase
- Input validation and error handling

### Code Structure
The project adheres to best practices for code structuring, readability, and maintainability. The repository is segmented into logical sections for easy navigation and comprehension.

### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
